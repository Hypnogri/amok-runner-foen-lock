# amok-runner-foen-lock
Amok Runner FOEN puzzle practice for speedrunning

This is a simple pygame-based python program that simulates the 4-number lock in Amok Runner.
The player can use the 'a' and 'd' keys to move the cursor left and right, respectively, 
and the 'w' and 's' keys to increment or decrement the digit at the current cursor position. 


Attempts are timed.
The game will reset with a new lock code after each reset.
Press ESC, ENTER, SPACE to reset the timer and get a new random two-letter combination.
